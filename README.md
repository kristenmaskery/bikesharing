## Project Overview
The objective of this analysis is to determine whether or not it is profitable for a bike rental company (CitiBike) to invest in an alternative city. The trip duration data allows us to understand the number of bikes rented, for how long, and when – therefore, using Python I must convert the given data to a datetime format using python in order to effectively analyze it In Tableau. Thereafter, I will create visualizations that showcase the company’s productivity.   

## Results
Using Tableau, I created several visualizations that analyze the type of user, the demographics of the user, the trip duration, the total amount of trips as well as the most popular times CitiBikes are used. The analysis indicated the following: 
•	A total of 2,344,224 trips were taken within the month of August. 
•	Of the total number of trips 1,900359 were users who subscribed to CitiBikes, and 443,865 users were customers. 
•	Additionally, of these total users 1,530,272 were male, 588,431 were female, and the remaining 225,521 being unknown. 
•	A majority of these users rent their bike for approximately 5-6 hours at a time. 
•	It is also indicated that for the month of August the peak ride time was on Thursday’s between 5:00 – 6:00pm.

## Summary
From the analysis conducted above it can be determined that the popularity of CitiBike’s is significant as can be noted by the larger number of loyal subscribers to irregular customers. More specifically, whether it is during the most popular weekday or hours, rides are being taken exponentially. Therefore, it is my proposal that CitiBike’s expand to other cities. 

##Further Recommendations 
While the data and visualizations provided above offers great insight into the productivity of CitiBikes in August, it would be beneficial to analyze the productivity of the company in the winter months. In presenting a comparative analysis between the months of August and January for example, the company would be able to see how the weather conditions affect its efficiency. Additionally, I would recommend conducting further analysis on which bike stations are used most frequently. This would allow the company to target specific city or rural areas with additional stations or bikes.
